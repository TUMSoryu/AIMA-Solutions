## Exercise 5.1 ##
This problem exercises the basic concepts of game-playing using Tic-Tac-Toe (noughts and
crosses) as an example. We define X[n] as the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with exactly
n X's and no O's. Similarly, O[n] is the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with just n O's. The
utility function thus assigns +1 to any position with X[3], = 1 and —1 to any position with O[3], - 1.

All other terminal positions have utility 0. We will use a linear evaluation function defined as
`Eval = 3*X[2] + X[1] - (3*O[2] + O[1])`

1. Approximately how many possible games of Tic-Tac-Toe are there?
2. Show the whole game tree starting from an empty board down to depth 2, (i.e., one X and
one O on the board), taking symmetry into account. You should have 3 positions at level
1 and 12 at level 2.
3. Mark on your tree the evaluations of all the positions at level 2.
4. Mark on your tree the backed-up values for the positions at levels 1 and 0, using the
minimax algorithm, and use them to choose the best starting move.
5. Circle the nodes at level 2 that would not be evaluated if alpha-beta pruning were applied,
assuming the nodes are generated in the optimal order for alpha-beta pruning.

### Solution ###
1. 9^3 (9 squares by 3 options [X, O, _] per square = 729
2. Level 1:
```
 X   Y   Z
X__ _X_ ___
___ ___ _X_
___ ___ ___

Level 2:
 A   B   C   D   E
XO_ X_O X__ X__ X__
___ ___ __O _O_ ___
___ ___ ___ ___ __O

 F   G   H   I   J
OX_ _X_ _X_ _X_ _X_
___ O__ _O_ ___ ___
___ ___ ___ O__ _O_

 K   L
_O_ O__
_X_ _X_
___ ___
```

3. A: 1, B: 0, C: 1, D: -1, E: 0
   F: -1, G: 0, H: -2, I: -1, J: 0
   K: 2, L: 1

4. X: -1, Y: -2, Z: 1

5. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J would all not be evaluated as Z is clearly a better choice


## Exercise 5.4 ##
The algorithms described in this chapter construct a search tree for each move from scratch.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of retaining the search tree from one move to the next
and extending the appropriate portion. How would tree retention interact with the use of selective
search to examine "useful" branches of the tree?

### Solution ###
Advantages:
  * Allows you to maintain of states to expand based on the evaluation function without having to recalculate anything

Disadvantages:
  * Takes up more memory
  * Ordering of states can become slow (depending on queuing insert type)

Tree retention would work as described in advantages


## Exercise 5.6 ##
Prove that with a positive linear transformation of leaf values, the move choice remains
unchanged in a game tree with chance nodes.

### Solution ###
Because expectimax uses the sum of the weighted max actions based on probabilities, if you apply a positive linear
transformation it will raise the value of all max actions but preserve the order, and also when the average is taken
the final expectimax values will be the original expectimax values shifted by the transformation. This means the
ordering after taking the expected value is also the same, and so the decision doesn't actually change


## Exercise 5.7 ##
Consider the following procedure for choosing moves in games with chance nodes:
  * Generate a suitable number (say, 50) dice-roll sequences down to a suitable depth (say, 8).
  * With known dice rolls, the game tree becomes deterministic. For each dice-roll sequence,
solve the resulting deterministic game tree using alpha-beta.
  * Use the results to estimate the value of each move and choose the best.

Will this procedure work correctly? Why (not)?

### Solution ###
It will work (is called Monte Carlo Search), but it's accuracy depends on the percentage of nodes cover. With 8 dice
rolls there are 8^6 (262,144) possible outcomes, so using 50 only covers 0.02% of those.


## Exercise 5.8 ##
Let us consider the problem of search in a three-player game. (You can assume no alliances
are allowed for now.) We will call the players 0, 1, and 2 for convenience. The first change is
that the evaluation function will return a list of three values, indicating (say) the likelihood of
winning for players 0, 1, and 2, respectively.

1. Complete the following game tree by filling in the backed-up value triples for all remaining
nodes, including the root
2. Rewrite Minimax-Decision and Minimax-Value so that they work correctly for the three-player game.
3. Discuss the problems that might arise if players could form and terminate alliances as well
as make moves "on the board." Indicate briefly how these problems might be addressed.

### Solution ###
1. See 3 Player Minimax.png
2.
```
function MINIMAX-DECISION(game) returns an operator
for each op in OPERATORS(do)
    VALUE[op] <- MINIMAX-VALUE(APPLY(op, game), game)
end
return the op with the highest VALUE[op]

function MINIMAX-VALUE(state, game) returns a utility value
if TERMINAL-TEST[game](state) then
    return UTILITY[game](state)
else
    return the highest MINIMAX-VALUE of SUCCESSORS(state) for player index in utility tuple
```
3. With alliances it means minimax won't work as the assumption that each player is acting independently in their best
interests is lost. E.g. In the example the the path always choosing option B will lead to a higher score for all players
than the minimax score, however the opportunity to backstab will override this. These problems could be addressed
by not allowing communication between players.


## Exercise 5.9 ##
Describe and implement a general game-playing environment for an arbitrary number of
players. Remember that time is part of the environment state, as well as the board position

### Solution ###
The only addition required is the player turn ordering so the players are aware of who acts after who.


## Exercise 5.10 ##
Suppose we play a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe in which each player sees only his or her own
moves. If the player makes a move on a square occupied by an opponent, the board "beeps" and
the player gets another try. Would the backgammon model suffice for this game, or would we
need something more sophisticated? Why?

### Solution ###
Not sure what the backgammon model is, but to describe this you would need to expand the tree for each unknown space
on the board each time. If the space returns a beep then you can fill it with a O and continue on that branch


## Exercise 5.11 ##
Describe and/or implement state descriptions, move generators, and evaluation functions
for one or more of the following games: backgammon, Monopoly, Scrabble, bridge (declarer
play is easiest).

### Solution ###
For Scrabble:
 - State description is the board tiles, letters placed, letters in the players hands, letters remaining in the bag
 - Move generators are the list of available word combinations from the scrabble dictionary
 - Evaluation Function: Current score (potentially with lookahead for potential high scores for the opponent)


## Exercise 5.12 ##
Consider carefully the interplay of chance events and partial information in each of the
games in Exercise 5.11.

1. For which is the standard expectiminimax model appropriate? Implement the algorithm
and run it in your game-playing agent, with appropriate modifications to the game-playing
environment.
2. For which would the scheme described in Exercise 5.7 be appropriate?
3. Discuss how you might deal with the fact that in some of the games, the players do not
have the same knowledge of the current state.

### Solution ###
1. Expectimax should work for all due to chance nodes and the best operator depending on the outcomes
2. It would give a reasonable approximation for most, but using 2 dice, or random letter tiles means
it would quickly lead to an unlikely situation
3. If the goal is the same (i.e. scrabble) you could check for possible words that would've score higher to see
what isn't in the players hand.


## Exercise 5.13 ##
The Chinook checkers program makes extensive use of endgame databases, which provide
exact values for every position within 6 moves of the end of the game. How might such databases
be generated efficiently?

### Solution ###
By taking advantage of symmetry for both players and sides (reduces space by a factor of 4).


## Exercise 5.14 ##
Discuss how well the standard approach to game playing would apply to games such as
tennis, pool, and croquet, which take place in a continuous, physical state space.

### Solution ###
Without modification the standard approach wouldn't work well. You would probably need to break time/space into tiles,
or include a physic engine of some sort in the operator to get an idea of the results of an action. Continuous space
makes search much more challenging


## Exercise 5.15 ##
For a game with which you are familiar, describe how an agent coduld be denned with
condition-action rules, subgoals (and their conditions for generation), and action-utility rules,
instead of by minimax search.

### Solution ###
For heads up poker you could define condition action rules including some history. Sub-goals include things like raising
the expected value of each hand as high as possible.  Action Utility rules can include if has an unbeatable hand then
utility is maxed


## Exercise 5.16 ##
The minimax algorithm returns the best move for MAX under the assumption that MIN
plays optimally. What happens when MIN plays suboptimally?

### Solution ###
This can result in MAX receiving a sub optimal result. Minimax is always about raising the lower bound of the
score received, and is not necessarily best for raising the average case


## Exercise 5.17 ##
We have assumed that the rules of each game define a utility function that is used by both
players, and that a utility of x for MAX means a utility of — x for MIN. Games with this property
are called zero-sum games. Describe how the minimax and alpha-beta algorithms change when
we have nonzero-sum games—that is, when each player has his or her own utility function. You
may assume that each player knows the other's utility function.

### Solution ###
In this case you can change the assumption to be that each player will act in their best interests. This means that
the utility function will output 2 values (one for each player), and the algorithm will recursively raise up the
utility set with the highest value for whichever players turn it is.
