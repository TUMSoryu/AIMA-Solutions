## Exercise 1.1 ##
Read Turing's original paper on AI (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several
potential objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections
still carry some weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from
developments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that by the year 2000, a computer
will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. Do
you think this is reasonable?

### Solution ###
The objections that are still commonly used are:
 - Consciousness objection that machines can't feel emotions in the same way as humans
 - Lady Lovelaces objection that machines can only do what they are programmed

His refutations are valid but they work by clarifying what it means to be intelligent

New objections may include things like that computers are designed to be sequential rather than parallel
and whether it's possible to have computer based parallel cores operate quickly enough to simulate a brain

Chat-bots are quite widely used (often for scamming people). This shows that if a person assumes they
are talking with a human that they can be quite easily fooled.


## Exercise 1.2 ##
We characterized the definitions of AI along two dimensions, human vs. ideal and thought
vs. action. But there are other dimensions that are worth considering. One dimension is whether
we are interested in theoretical results or in practical applications. Another is whether we intend
our intelligent computers to be conscious or not. Philosophers have had a lot to say about this
issue, and although most AI researchers are happy to leave the questions to the philosophers,
there has been heated debate. The claim that machines can be conscious is called the strong AI
claim; the weak AI position makes no such claim. Characterize the eight definitions on page
5 and the seven following definitions according to the four dimensions we have mentioned and
whatever other ones you feel are helpful.
Artificial intelligence is ...

1. "a collection of algorithms that are computationally tractable, adequate approximations of
intractably specified problems" (Partridge, 1991)
2. "the enterprise of constructing a physical symbol system that can reliably pass the Turing
Test" (Ginsberg, 1993)
3. "the field of computer science that studies how machines can be made to act intelligently"
(Jackson, 1986)
4. "a field of study that encompasses computational techniques for performing tasks that
apparently require intelligence when performed by humans" (Tanimoto, 1990)
5. "a very general investigation of the nature of intelligence and the principles and mechanisms
required for understanding or replicating it" (Sharpies et ai, 1989)
6. "the getting of computers to do things that seem to be intelligent" (Rowe, 1988).

### Solution ###
Human vs. Ideal (H/I)
Thought vs. Action (T/A)
Theoretical vs. Practical (T/P)
Conscious vs. Unconscious (C/U)

1. ITPU
2. HAPU
3. IAPU
4. HAPU
5. ITTC
6. IAPU


## Exercise 1.3 ##
There are well-known classes of problems that are intractably difficult for computers,
and other classes that are provably undecidable by any computer. Does this mean that AI is
impossible?

### Solution ###
No. This means the problems are intractible for humans as well but that heuristics exist that can be used
to generate good enough approximations of results.


## Exercise 1.4 ##
Suppose we extend Evans's ANALOGY program so that it can score 200 on a standard IQ
test. Would we then have a program more intelligent than a human? Explain

No. Intelligence is the skill of generating and applying accurate predictive models of the world
based on percepts, actions, and rewards. An IQ test focuses more on pattern recognition and state manipulation
which is only a subset of this.


## Exercise 1.5 ##
Examine the AI literature to discover whether or not the following tasks can currently be
solved by computers:

1. Playing a decent game of table tennis (ping-pong).
2. Driving in the center of Cairo.
3. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level.
4. Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems.
5. Writing an intentionally funny story.
6. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law.
7. Translating spoken English into spoken Swedish in real time.

For the currently infeasible tasks, try to find out what the difficulties are and estimate when they
will be overcome.

### Solution ###
1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Yes
4. Yes
5. No - Generating surprise and finding hidden relationships in language/life
6. Yes
7. Yes


## Exercise 1.6 ##
Find an article written by a lay person in a reputable newspaper or magazine claiming
the achievement of some intelligent capacity by a machine, where the claim is either wildly
exaggerated or false.

### Solution ###
Companies claiming to have created AGI


## Exercise 1.8 ##
Some authors have claimed that perception and motor skills are the most important part of
intelligence, and that "higher-level" capacities are necessarily parasitic—simple add-ons to these
underlying facilities. Certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been devoted
to perception and motor skills, whereas AI has found tasks such as game playing and logical
inference to be easier, in many ways, than perceiving and acting in the real world. Do you think
that AI's traditional focus on higher-level cognitive abilities is misplaced?

### Solution ###
No. These skills are required to operate in the 'real world', but are not required to create an intelligent system.


## Exercise 1.9 ##
"Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their programmers tell
them." Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

### Solution ###
Yes, No. It just needs to be programmed in a flexible way that allows for internal decisions to alter internal functions


## Exercise 1.10 ##
"Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their genes tell them." Is
the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

### Solution ###
Yes, No. Brain operates in a flexible way allowing for the process described above
