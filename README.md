Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach Exercise Solutions

I'm using the First Edition of the book which is a little out of date. So if you're looking
for solutions to later versions you're probably going to be out of luck unless they somehow match up.

Broken down by chapter where each chapter contains README summarising how the solutions work
Each chapter also containing a link to flash cards relevant to that chapter
