## Exercise 3.1 ##
Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation

### Solution ###
The goal is part of the problem definition. A different goal can result in an entirely different problem


## Exercise 3.2 ##
Consider the accessible, two-location vacuum world under Murphy's Law. Show that for
each initial state, there is a sequence of actions that is guaranteed to reach a goal state.

### Solution ###
Since the world is accessible you can just follow the steps: If there is dirt then suck, else move


## Exercise 3.3 ##
Give the initial state, goal test, operators, and path cost function for each of the following.
There are several possible formulations for each problem, with varying levels of detail. The
main thing is that your formulations should be precise and "hang together" so that they could be
implemented.

1. You want to find the telephone number of Mr. Jimwill Zollicoffer, who lives in Alameda,
given a stack of directories alphabetically ordered by city.
2. As for part (a), but you have forgotten Jimwill's last name.
3. You are lost in the Amazon jungle, and have to reach the sea. There is a stream nearby.
4. You have to color a complex planar map using only four colors, with no two adjacent
regions to have the same color.
5. A monkey is in a room with a crate, with bananas suspended just out of reach on the ceiling.
He would like to get the bananas.
6. You are lost in a small country town, and must find a drug store before your hay fever
becomes intolerable. There are no maps, and the natives are all locked indoors.

### Solution ###
#### Q1 ####
  * Initial State - x phone books containing n names
  * Goal Test - Does the name match
  * Operators - Select phone book: set of pages; select page: set of names; select name.
  * Past Cost - Time taken to find name
  * Algorithm - Select directory by town name, select page by start of last name, select name by first name

#### Q2 ####
  * Initial State - x phone books containing n names
  * Goal Test - Does the name match
  * Operators - Select phone book: set of pages; select page: set of names; select name.
  * Past Cost - Time taken to find name
  * Algorithm - Select directory by town name, go through each page searching for first-name

#### Q3 ####
  * Initial State - Position lat/long/alt, location of sea
  * Goal Test - Are you at the sea
  * Operators - Walk
  * Past Cost - Time taken to reach sea
  * Algorithm - Follow stream downhill as sea is at 0 alt

#### Q4 ####
  * Initial State - Position/Edges of planes
  * Goal Test - Are all plane colored with no adjacent regions having matching colours
  * Operators - Fill plane with 1 of four colours
  * Past Cost - Number of actions required
  * Algorithm - CSP, can use algorithms like Most Constrained Variable

#### Q5 ####
  * Initial State - Location of monkey, box and bananas
  * Goal Test - Does the monkey have the bananas
  * Operators - Monkey can move itself and the box
  * Past Cost - Time taken
  * Algorithm - Move box under bananas. Means-Ends Analysis

#### Q6 ####
  * Initial State - Town layout, your location
  * Goal Test - Are you at the drug store
  * Operators - Walk, look, make map
  * Past Cost - Time taken
  * Algorithm - Walk towards most built-up area and work out from there


## Exercise 3.4 ##
Implement the missionaries and cannibals problem and use breadth-first search to find the
shortest solution. Is it a good idea to check for repeated states? Draw a diagram of the complete
state space to help you decide

### Solution ###
missionaries_and_cannibals.py implements environment/search based on book description. Unfortunately the book
description is unsolvable because it only considers end points to be important, whereas the actual solution requires
a separate variable for who is sitting in the boat, rather than just who is on which side of the bank.

May add actual solution as a later stage


## Exercise 3.5 ##
On page 76, we said that we would not consider problems with negative path costs. In this
exercise, we explore this in more depth.

1. Suppose that a negative lower bound c is placed on the cost of any given step â€” that is,
negative costs are allowed, but the cost of a step cannot be less than c. Does this allow
uniform-cost search to avoid searching the whole tree?
2. Suppose that there is a set of operators that form a loop, so that executing the set in some
order results in no net change to the state. If all of these operators have negative cost, what
does this imply about the optimal behavior for an agent in such an environment? :
3. One can easily imagine operators with high negative cost, even in domains such as route-finding.
For example, some stretches of road might have such beautiful scenery as to far j
outweigh the normal costs in terms of time and fuel. Explain, in precise terms, why humans
do not drive round scenic loops indefinitely, and explain how to define the state space and I
operators for route-finding so that artificial agents can also avoid looping.
4. Can you think of a real domain in which step costs are such as to cause looping?

### Solution ###

1. Not if it wants to find the optimal solution, because there is always the possible of a loop of
negative cost in the future that can undo all positive cost actions
2. If they are the only negative cost nodes in the environment then the agents optimal behaviour is a continuous loop
3. You can explain this by states having a bias that decays towards 0 each time the agent visits. It starts at a large
negative cost and reduces down until taking the scenic route has less utility than taking the freeway
4. If a vacuum bot's reward was based on only dirt picked up it could constantly loop picking up and putting down dirt


## Exercise 3.6 ##
The GENERAL-SEARCH algorithm consists of three steps: goal test, generate, and ordering function, in that order.
It seems a shame to generate a node that is in fact a solution, but to fail to recognize it because the ordering
function fails to place it first.

1. Write a version of GENERAL-SEARCH that tests each node as soon as it is generated and stops immediately if it has found a goal.
2. Show how the GENERAL-SEARCH algorithm can be used unchanged to do this by giving it the proper ordering function

### Solution ###

1. GeneralSearchImmediateCheck() in immediate_search.py
2. BreadthFirstSearchImmediateCheck() in immediate_search.py


## Exercise 3.7 ##
The formulation of problem, solution, and search algorithm given in this chapter explicitly
mentions the path to a goal state. This is because the path is important in many problems. For
other problems, the path is irrelevant, and only the goal state matters. Consider the problem
"Find the square root of 123454321." A search through the space of numbers may pass through
many states, but the only one that matters is the goal state, the number 11111. Of course, from a
theoretical point of view, it is easy to run the general search algorithm and then ignore all of the
path except the goal state. But as a programmer, you may realize an efficiency gain by coding a
version of the search algorithm that does not keep track of paths. Consider a version of problem
solving where there are no paths and only the states matter. Write definitions of problem and
solution, and the general search algorithm. Which of the problems in Section 3.3 would best use
this algorithm, and which should use the version that keeps track of paths?

### Solution ###
Problem - Solving a jigsaw puzzle
Solution - When each piece is in it's correct spot
General Search - Where does each piece need to be placed

Because all actions can be considered independently the ordering of the paths are irrelevant, and so the problem
can be solved with needing to keep track of paths


## Exercise 3.8 ##
Given a pathless search algorithm such as the one called for in Exercise 3.7, explain how
you can modify the operators to keep track of the paths as part of the information in a state. Show
the operators needed to solve the route-finding and touring problems.

### Solution ###
Since the node contains the parent node and the operator, you can just trace back through to parent nodes to
determine what operations where need to get to that point, without it needing to be contained in the state itself


## Exercise 3.9 ##
Describe a search space in which iterative deepening search performs much worse than depth-first search

### Solution ###
Depth First would perform better if the branching factor is very low but goal state quite deep, or the correct path
happens to be down the path of the first options.


## Exercise 3.10 ##
Figure 3.17 shows a schematic view of bidirectional search. Why do you think we chose
to show trees growing outward from the start and goal states, rather than two search trees growing
horizontally toward each other

### Solution ###
The dimensions along with the search space expands is only dependent on the root node and search policy,
the goal node could essentially be positioned around any point of the start node


## Exercise 3.11 ##
Write down the algorithm for bidirectional search, in pseudo-code or in a programming
language. Assume that each search will be a breadth-first search, and that the forward and
backward searches take turns expanding a node at a time. Be careful to avoid checking each node
in the forward search against each node in the backward search

### Solution ###
BidirectionalSearch() in search.py. Uses updated GeneralSearch with hashed nodes and step expansion ability


## Exercise 3.12 ##
Give the time complexity of bidirectional search when the test for connecting the two
searches is done by comparing a newly generated state in the forward direction against all the
states generated in the backward direction, one at a time.

### Solution ###
O(n^2). Worst case every node gets compared to half the other nodes (constant factor)


## Exercise 3.13 ##
We said that at least one direction of a bidirectional search must be a breadth-first search.
What would be a good choice for the other direction? Why?

For optimality with constant step cost BFS or UCS will work, depth first could run into loops.
From the goal-side searches point of view there is just has an additional goal node added every step.


## Exercise 3.14 ##
Consider the following operator for the 8-queens problem: place a queen in the column
with the fewest un-attacked squares, in such a way that it does not attack any other queens. How
many nodes does this expand before it finds a solution? (You may wish to have a program
calculate this for you.)

### Solution ###
Run n_queens.py with search as relevant algorithm. Using DepthFirst can solve in with approx 2,000 nodes expanded.
Using BreadthFirst can solve with approx 120,000 checks (much slower from list concatenation as well)


## Exercise 3.15 ##
The chain problem (Figure 3.20) consists of various lengths of chain that must be reconfigured
into new arrangements. Operators can open one link and close one link. In the standard
form of the problem, the initial state contains four chains, each with three links. The goal state
consists of a single chain of 12 links in a circle. Set this up as a formal search problem and find
the shortest solution.

### Solution ###
See chain_problem.py. Quite slow as deepcopy of node takes time and problem has high branching factor.
Implementation slightly different to description as each side can be independently opened and closed,
as opposed to link being open and having a maximum of 2 other links added. May revisit in future

Shortest solution 8 actions for this model, either by opening and connecting each edge link,
or by breaking apart one chain into 3 links and connecting each of them.


## Exercise 3.16 ##
Tests of human intelligence often contain sequence prediction problems. The aim in
such problems is to predict the next member of a sequence of integers, assuming that the number
in position n of the sequence is generated using some sequence function s(n), where the first
element of the sequence corresponds to n = 0. For example, the function s(n) = 2**n generates the
sequence [1,2,4,8,16, ...].

In this exercise, you will design a problem-solving system capable of solving such prediction
problems. The system will search the space of possible functions until it finds one that
matches the observed sequence. The space of sequence functions that we will consider consists
of all possible expressions built from the elements 1 and n, and the functions +, x, â€”, /, and
exponentiation. For example, the function 2**n becomes (1 + 1)**n in this language. It will be useful
to think of function expressions as binary trees, with operators at the internal nodes and 1 's and
n's at the leaves.

1. First, write the goal test function. Its argument will be a candidate sequence function s. It
will contain the observed sequence of numbers as local state.
2. Now write the successor function. Given a function expression s, it should generate all
expressions one step more complex than s. This can be done by replacing any leaf of the
expression with a two-leaf binary tree.
3. Which of the algorithms discussed in this chapter would be suitable for this problem?
Implement it and use it to find sequence expressions for the sequences [1,2,3,4,5],
[1,2,4,8,16, ...],and [0.5,2,4.5,8].
4. If level d of the search space contains all expressions of complexity d +1, where complexity
is measured by the number of leaf nodes (e.g., n + (1 x n) has complexity 3), prove by
induction that there are roughly 20**d*(d+1)! expressions at level d.
5. Comment on the suitability of uninformed search algorithms for solving this problem. Can
you suggest other approaches?

### Solution ###
1. See goal_test(node) in sequence_predictor.py
2. See expand_node(node) in sequence_predictor.py
3. [1,2,3,4,5] = (1 + n); [1,2,4,8,16, ...] = ((1+1)**n); [0.5,2,4.5,8] = ((n+1)**(1+1))/(1+1) (Manual guess,
stopped program after 40,000 searches ~ 15 minutes)
4. d layers ** (5 symbols [+, -, *, /, **] x 2 items [1, n] x (d-1)! groupings [() around sub groupings])
= 10**(d*(d-1)!). Not sure how 20**d*(d+1)! came amount
5. Very unsuitable, search space contains many reversible functions. Other approaches could be attempted to generate
a range of valid values and use those in some way, e.g. store a way to get 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. in self contained nodes
and then combine then with n. Or identify nodes that have no effect, like (n-n) = 0, and don't expand nodes
containing those structures


## Exercise 3.17 ##
The full vacuum world from the exercises in Chapter 2 can be viewed as a search problem
in the sense we have defined, provided we assume that the initial state is completely known.

1. Define the initial state, operators, goal test function, and path cost function.
2. Which of the algorithms defined in this chapter would be appropriate for this problem?
3. Apply one of them to compute an optimal sequence of actions for a 3 x 3 world with dirt in
the center and home squares.
4. Construct a search agent for the vacuum world, and evaluate its performance in a set of
3x3 worlds with probability 0.2 of dirt in each square. Include the search cost as well as
path cost in the performance measure, using a reasonable exchange rate.
5. Compare the performance of your search agent with the performance of the agents constructed
for the exercises in Chapter 2. What happens if you include computation time in
the performance measure, at various "exchange rates" with respect to the cost of taking a
step in the environment?
6. Consider what would happen if the world was enlarged to n x n. How does the performance
of the search agent vary with n? Of the reflex agents?

### Solution ###
1.  * Initial State: [[A->, D][D, E]]. Grid of 2x2 with agent in top left facing right and dirt in 2 squares
  * Operators: Move Forward, Suck, Turn Left, Turn Right, Switch Off
  * Goal Test: If there no dirt and is the agent switched off while sitting on the home square
  * Path Cost: +1 per action taken, -100 for piece of dirt sucked up, 1000 for not being on home square when switching off.
To make this monotonic can make it 101 per action taken, 0 if sucking up dirt, 1100 for not being on home square
2. Uniform Cost. You want to minimise path cost while reaching the goal
3. Set env = make_3x3() in vacuum_world.py and run using UniformCostSearch
(UniformCost solves in 502, BreadthFirst in 624)
4. Set env = make_random_3x3() in vacuum_world.py and include search_cost in search.find_path() arguments
5. If the search cost is higher enough then it can be more effective to use a simpler agent
6. Can create a standard VacuumEnvironment() and apply search to test this. Search space expands by roughly
(height * width) ^ actions where height and width are the number of new cells added. Percentage of dirt also
has huge impact as each additional piece of dirt is normally 5 actions added [2 x turns, 2 x move, 1 x suck],
e.g. 3x3 filled with dirt take around 28 actions (from manual solution), which is 28^5 states to expand


## Exercise 3.18 ##
The search agents we have discussed make use of a complete model of the world to
construct a solution that they then execute. Modify the depth-first search algorithm with repeated
state checking so that an agent can use it to explore an arbitrary vacuum world even without a
model of the locations of walls and dirt. It should not get stuck even with loops or dead ends.
You may also wish to have your agent construct an environment description of the type used by
the standard search algorithms.

### Solution ###
All search classes implement state checking via state/operator hashing


## Exercise 3.19 ##
In discussing the cryptarithmetic problem, we proposed that an operator should assign
a value to whichever letter has the least remaining possible values. Is this rule guaranteed to
produce the smallest possible search space? Why (not)?

### Solution ###
No. Reducing the search space involves restricting possible actions, assigning a value based on variables
with the least remaining possible values will have the opposite effect of keeping the branching factor high
and therefore the search space large


## Exercise 3.20 ##
Define each of the following as constraint satisfaction problems:

1. The cryptarithmetic problem.
2. The channel-routing problem in VLSI layout.
3. The map-coloring problem. In map-coloring, the aim is to color countries on a map using
a given set of colors, such that no two adjacent countries are the same color.
4. The rectilinear floor-planning problem, which involves finding non-overlapping places in
a large rectangle for a number of smaller rectangles.

### Solution ###
1. * X = {(L1, ..., Ln), W1, W2, W3}  Each letter plus three words
   * D = {(0, 1, ..., 9), [L1, ..., Ln], [L1, ..., Ln], [L1, ..., Ln]}  Holds a number or a list of letter
   * C = { R(W1) + R(W2) = R(W3) } When letters are replaced (R) with numbers the sequence must be a valid addition

2. Not sure how VLSI works, may come back to this

3. * X = {(Countries)}  Each country defined by edges
   * D = {(Colors)}  Set of colors
   * C = { For all x1, x2 Adjacent(x1, x2) must have Color(x1) != Color(x2) }

4. * X = {Large Rectangle Dimensions}
   * D = {[Small rectangles]}
   * C = { For All x Position(x) on the large rectangle there exists 1 PositionSR(x) or 0 PositionSR(x) }
Logic is a bit rusty, may come back after later chapters


## Exercise 3.21 ##
Implement a constraint satisfaction system as follows:

1. Define a data-type for CSPs with finite, discrete domains. You will need to find a way to
represent domains and constraints.
2. Implement operators that assign values to variables, where the variables are assigned in a
fixed order at each level of the tree.
3. Implement a goal test that checks a complete state for satisfaction of all the constraints.
4. Implement backtracking by modifying DEPTH-FIRST-SEARCH.
5. Add forward checking to your backtracking algorithm.
6. Run the three algorithms on some sample problems and compare their performance.

### Solution ###
1. See classes Variable() and ConstraintSatisfactionProblem() in csp.py
2. See solve() in ConstraintSatisfactionSolver() in csp.py
3. See is_solution() in ConstraintSatisfactionProblem() in csp.py
4. Check for if is_valid added to start of solve() as well as depth-first queuing at end of solve()
5. See forward_checking() in ConstraintSatisfactionSolver()
6. Trivial CSP with values in a 2x2 array with constraint and goal included in csp.py
